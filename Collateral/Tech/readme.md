## We have Cable TV, Antenna Hookups, Telephone, WIFI, and Ethernet fed to our units.
-  There are five "wires" comming from a "Secret Room" in the building that bring those services to a panel in our laundry room.
   -  High Voltage is distributed through a "Fuse Box", Low Voltage uses a "panel"
   -  Engineers like to use the word "Cable" for wires that don't carry high voltate electrical power.
   -  The special technicians that hooked up our services are called "Low Voltage Techs".
   -  We will use the term "cable" from now on, so we seem "technical" too!
#### Here is a picture of that panel, along with what's inside.

   -  Inside the low voltage panel, a few simple devices spread services to wall jacks thoughout our units.
      -  Data (Ethernet) cables and Voice (Phone) cables connect to colorful gadgets that allow easier hookup.
         -  Some people call these gadgets "Patch Panels".
         -  The thinner Data (Ethernet) cables by convention are usually blue,  the thin Voice (phone) cables are usually white.
         -  TV and Antenna cables are usually bigger, rounder, and stiffer than data and voice cables.
            -  They are called "Coaxial Cables" due to their cross section and radial symmetry (Think Bullseye or Target).  
      -  The white Cable TV cables use a simple "splitter" to distribute that service around to rooms.
         -  The splitter just dangles there - one cable in and many cables out to the rooms.
      -  The "antenna" cables (Usually the thick black ones.) are not connected - You will notive no "spliter", they just hang there unused.
         - The fellow that took the pictures hooked his own antenna and splitter up.  Check out the gadget with the blue Light.

#### Here are pictures of the two kinds of jack plates most of us have on various walls.	 
-  An appropriate cable runs back to the panel for each "port" on these jack-plates.

-  The technicians that installed our low voltage systems did an excellent job, labeling and organizing things consistently.
   -  Unfortunately, it's hard to be usefully verbose when writing on a cable, so an organization legend is necessary.  
-  Each jack-plate is numbered, and the ports are labeled by by Spectrum for the service they provide.
   -  You could just note the number, and connect up cables in the panel from that.<br> <br>
-  **To avoid crawling around, Spectrum provided two good legends that map wall plate names to cable numbers.**
-  Here's how Spectrum created names for wall plate locations.  (This took a while to figure out!)
    -  *Spectrun uses the terms "TV" and "Data" to **name the plate type** as shown above.*
       -  TV plates have four "ports", Data plates have two.
       -  On the legend, the physical location and the plate type are combined into a location name.
    -  "Living Room TV" on the legend tells us which wall plate in the living room it refers to.
    -  "Living Room Data" on the legend tells us that another (slightly different) wall plate is nearby.
    -  Spectrum's legends might be more verbose.  "Living Room TV Left" and "Living Room Data Right" are examples of two nearby wall plate locations.
   -  The location names are in numbered boxes on the legends.
   -  The box number (in the legend table) denotes both the plate number and it's cable numbers.
      - All services will use that same number for a given wall plate.
-  Only the Data system and Voice systems use patch panels, locations numbered accordingly. <br> <br>
-  The Cable TV and (unused) antenna cables follow the same numbering system.
   -  You get the number off your jack plate or infer from the legend on the door, and read a label stuck to the black or white cable.
