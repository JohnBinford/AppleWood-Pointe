## We have Cable TV, Antenna Hookups, Telephone, WIFI, and Ethernet fed to our units.
-  There are five "wires" comming from a "Secret Room" in the building that bring those services to a panel in our laundry room.  The panel looks like a medicine cabinet with a plastic door covering the stuff inside.  
   -  From that area, a few simple devices spread those services to wall jacks thoughout our units.
      -  Data (Ethernet) and Voice (Phone) wires connect to white and blue gadgets that allow easier hookup.
         -  Somne people call these gadgets "Patch Panels".
         -  The Cable TV uses a simple "splitter" to distribute that service around to rooms.  It just dangles there - one in many out.   	   
#### Here is a picture of that panel, along with what's inside.

#### Here are pictures of the two kinds of jack sets most of us have on various walls.	 
-  An appropriate wire runs back to the panel for each "port" on these jack-plates.
   -  Note that each jack-plate is also numbered, and the ports are labeled by the service they provide.
      -  The wire's labels inside the panel will match.
      -  The port labels for data and voice match the legends on the inside of the door.
      -  The TV and (unused) antenna cables follow the same numbering and namgin scheme.
