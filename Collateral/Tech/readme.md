## We have Cable TV, Antenna Hookups, Telephone, WIFI, and Ethernet fed to our units.
-  There are five "wires" comming from a "Secret Room" in the building that bring those services to a panel in our laundry room.
   -  Engineers like to use the word "Cable" for wires that don't carry high voltate electrical power.
   -  The special technicians that hooked up our services are called "Low Voltage Techs".
-  The panel looks like a medicine cabinet with a plastic door covering the stuff inside.  
   -  From that area, a few simple devices spread those services to wall jacks thoughout our units.
      -  Data (Ethernet) wires and Voice (Phone) wires connect to white and blue gadgets that allow easier hookup.
         -  Some people call these gadgets "Patch Panels".
         -  The Data (Ethernet) wires by convention are usually blue,  the Voice (phone) wires are usually white.
      -  The Cable TV uses a simple "splitter" to distribute that service around to rooms.  It just dangles there - one in and many out.
      -  The "antenna" wires (Usually the thick black ones.) are not connected - Note no "spliter", they jsut hang there.   	   
#### Here is a picture of that panel, along with what's inside.

#### Here are pictures of the two kinds of jack plates most of us have on various walls.	 
-  An appropriate wire runs back to the panel for each "port" on these jack-plates.
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Spectrum calls these "TV"</th>
		<th>Spectrum calls these "Data"</th>
	</tr>	
	<tr> 
		<td>

		<td>
			<img src="./Data-Jacks.jpg">
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

-  Note that each jack-plate is also numbered, and the ports are labeled by by Spectrum for the service they provide.
-  Here's the confusing bit.
    -  Spectrun uses the terms "TV" and "Data" to know which of the two legend inside the door to use.
    -  Both the Telephone legend and the Data legend use these terms to find a jack plate.
       -  Only the Data system and telephone system use patch panels, so only they need numbered legends.  
    -  "Living Room TV" on the legend tells us which wall plate it refers to.
    -  "Living Room Data" on the legend tells us that another (slightly different) wall place is nearby.
    -  Spectrum's legends might be more verbose.  "Living Room TV Left" and "Living Room Data Right" are examples of two nearby wall plate locations.
-  The TV and (unused) antenna cables follow the same numbering.  You get the number off your jack plate, and read a label stuck to the black or white cable.
