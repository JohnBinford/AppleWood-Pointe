## We have Cable TV, Antenna Hookups, Telephone, WIFI, and Ethernet fed to our units.
-  Often, people use plumbing and hoses as models to describe how various kinds of "wires" bring us services.
	-  There are five "wires" comming from a "Secret Room" in the building that bring those services to a panel in our laundry room.  It is similar to a medicine cabinet with a plastic door covering the stuff inside.
	 -  From that area, a few simple devices spread those services to wall jacks thoughout our units.
#### Here is a picture of that panel, along with what's inside.
