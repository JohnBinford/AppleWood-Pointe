-  As a 04-25-2023 Workshop Meeting follow-up:
   - On the website you might add something like
   - Group agreed on Equipment Recommended  ...
   - All those with equipment x'ed but not recommended;
     - Len-B, Len-C, Linelle-J, Ralph-L, Gary-L, Rick-S, Jack-W, & Dave-Z (except for Jim-W who wasn't in attendance) and all others in attendance agreed - voted to go with Equipment Recommended.
   - Those not in attendance (except for Jim-E) had no equipment.
- In looking at it as a vote;
  - In Attendance (13 of 20) unanimously agreed-voted on equipment recommended.
  - Out of Area.... (01 of 20) didn't vote.
  - No Response (06 of 20) didn't vote.
  - So the vote was 13 to 7 for equipment recommended and the 7 weren't no votes, just non-voters.

- So, do you think we should ask the 7 non-voters... Jim-E, David-J, Dick-M, Kevin-S, Jim-T, Dick-V, & Jim-W <br>
if they agree with the above equipment recommended, or just let it go with the equipment recommended decision-vote
as they are outvoted anyway?
