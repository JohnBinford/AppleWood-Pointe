#### Topic:  We will need to reach out to those that purchase any of the 9 remaining units.
-  Linelle-J commented 1/18/23:  I read the new Applewood Pointe email the other day which stated there were only nine units left to sell.  We'll have to be sure that we reach out to the new arrivals that have signed up since the last meeting.  Maybe this can be done at the next luncheon on February 8th.
-  Eric-S replied 1/18/23:  I think I will get a few more business cards printed and ask (again) that the sales office hand them out whenever possible.</br>
We can also call a meeting at the February luncheon, and hand them out there too!

         - John will regularly monitor his email for comments, wait a week or so for replies and then forward the digest with the new replys to the group.
         - He will regularly organize the threads and then post them here in digest format, occasionally forwarding the digest to the group as significant information is collected.
         - In order to be respectful of excess spam, John may consolidate comments and questions if there are many.

        -  Donald-D replied 01/23/23:</br>If you don't know the difference between the same type of tools or equipment, it would be better to go with the recommended ones than not to vote at all.

####  Topic:  Website use for discussing the shop. (Submitted by Ralph-L.)
-  Ralph-L Commented 1/18/23:</br>Dear pending Workshop Users:</br>  At the first Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Luncheon, those who were interested in the Workshop got together and gave their email addresses to Eric Strandjord (John Binford). </br>
He offered to set up an internet site for all to email each other.  But no one wanted to have to "Sign Up" for anything or use any tool that required a "Sign In" or "User ID" with "Password".   So he set up a Website for the Group to use where they would only have to enter or click on johnathan.binford@gmail.com , and John would do all the "Group Email" work for them.  He has now updated this on the Website as follows below: </br> </br>
***Please let us know if and how you have used our Website, along with your comments (suggestions) on it?*** </br> </br>Thanks! </br> Ralph-L
-  Eric-S replied 01/18/23:</br>  Ralph.  Thanks for the inspiration to think about the shop for a bit.</br>- The website will serve as an archive for all the informatin we might exchange.  No going through emails!</br>- I've worked hard to keep the website fresh over the past 9 months, posting new information three times a week on average.</br>- Few of our CraftsMen have taken a peek.</br>- We've made over 1486 additions to the website during that time, including new CraftsMen profiles, and a master tool list and numerous individual lists for those that have offered major shop tools.</br>- There are now many links to pictures from other shops, constrsuction photos from AWP, documents, and drawings that would be usefull for planning the shop layout.</br>- We've communicated out electrical needs to Sales and Engineering.  A diagram is included on the website's main page, along with renders of what our shop might look like. </br>
