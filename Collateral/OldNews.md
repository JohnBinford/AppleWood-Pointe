## News prior to September 2023.

   -  Linelle Johnson was going to bring his, but he has offered to "keep it", and have John bring his nicer saw to the shop.
-  There was a bit of disucssion about shop safety.
   - The gang concluded that certain items MUST have certtain guards and other safety attachments - especially on Table Saws.
      -  We decided to check on the current saws that we elected, and came up with alternatives if necessary.
      -  Jack had recently offered a Swiss-built Table saw that has safety and many other jigs and attachments. 
         -  The Gang of four (leadership busybodies) have asked for Jack's versatile saw!

###  You might remember some email chatter about  the fact that 13 of us met at the Dakota County Library to chat about shop stuff.
	     
-  The 13 CraftsMen discussed what to do with smaller power tools and hand tools.
   - A goal is to have a nice collection of "portable" tools that can be "checked out" for use outside of the shop.
   - We settled on using a "common sense" approach.
   - If you have something that's unique, common but new, or potentially popular we encourage donating it to the shop. 
	- The shop website was reviewed as a foundation for various discussions.

- Until that meeting, organizers had concentrated on settling the disposition of large electric shop tools.  (The stuff that’s hard to move without planning…)
  - Letting potential donors know what will be needed and what they might need to otherwise dispose of was the group's primary job.
  - Eric S. produced some lists with pictures of large shop tools the still needed some type of decision.
  - After that constructive discussion, the group unanimously agreed to stand with the recommendation of the Gang of Four - (Busybodies that have been working on shop issues since 2021).

 - A spreadsheet representing the list of what large shop tools various craftsmen should plan to bring to the shop is liniked below.
   - Please check out the list, and plan to bring any items highlighted in green!  Thanks a ton to those that participated.

 ### Older New and Updates.
 
 - Five CraftsMen recent met to discuss tool submissions and next steps to getting organized.
   - Here are the "minutes of that meeting...
   
   In Attendance:  Linelle Johnson, Ralph Lavansky, Dave Porter, Eric Strandjord, & Jack Weidenbach

The attached 1:00 P.M. Tuesday, December 20th, 2022, Meeting Agenda was followed (see attached below).

All of our pending Workshop Users have now submitted their Tools / Equipment that they are considering donating to the Workshop for us to make our selections from, or have stated that they prefer we just choose from those already submitted by others.

The group went through the " APAV Workshop User Tools / Equipment Submitted" report and picked what was thought to be the best, to recommend to all to vote on (see attached below).

Eric showed examples of his selection software and group chose the one sheet pictures of each type with voting boxes to be checked next to pictures on it.  Group indicated that the recommended ones would be indicated on the sheets of each type.  And suggested that only ones we need to vote on (more than one item or number of items we want to keep) be dispersed - on website or email only, with deadline and if they don't vote just go with votes received (to be reviewed before results are sent out).  Also to include voting item asking if they prefer to just go with what others vote on, and not to vote themselves.

Communication to be sent to all users prior to the end of the year - thanking all for getting their Tools / Equipment considerations in and letting them know what we feel will be next.

The Meeting was adjourned at 4:00 P.M. .
