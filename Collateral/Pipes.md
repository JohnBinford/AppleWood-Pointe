## One of the guys wondered what the strange square metal "pipe" was in the ceiling of a common area.
-  John recently spotted this collection of those pipes in Stacy's recent picture upload.
   -  If anyone knows what they might be, please email John.  johnathan.binford@gmail.com </br>

-  Here's an earlier picture of one of those heavy looking pipes in the overhead somewhere...</br>

- With the help of Doug,  John speculates that these heavy pipes are "guides" to allow for a "rope" to be "dangled" from the eaves of each unit.  (You can see them protruding throiugh the soffits centered on the main window of each unit.)
  - One would go into the attic with a special rope with a small weight and feed it through the end of this pipe from the catwalk that's already up there...

- Sometimes the trick to a successful google search is to learn the terminology.
  - I read started with “Rope Descent Equipment” and after about ten steps found the term “Rigging Sleeve”
  - A quick new search found these...

 - I think those long square tubes are indeed for window washing —  just a home made version of a cmmercial product.
