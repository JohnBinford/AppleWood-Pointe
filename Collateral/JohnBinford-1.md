Applewood Pointe Hobby Shop. (Machine shop? Wood shop?)

Many of us will have tools with no room to keep them. Some might be appropriate for the new

hobby shop.

As we transition to our new homes, many of us have already started “downsizing” and

reducing clutter and home inventory, including items in our own workshops.

• It would be good to know in advance what might be used in our new hobby shop.

• Then, we each can make plans to dispose of the remainder of our prized tool collection.

A few of us future residents have casually discussed “getting things organized” at various AWP

events. We established that an ***easy*** means of communications should be established as a way

to choose the “best of the best” for our new shop. (At the last luncheon, I realized that the

other gents have way better power tools than I, so mine will go to a nephew and to charity)

With input from those few fellows (no women so far, but craftsperson-ship has no gender), I

have created an **email mailbox** to represent the Hobby Shop, and a **website** to easily collect

pictures and information with a simple structure.

A private - central email account for pictures, lists, information, and comments.

Email:

<Johnathan.binford@gmail.com>

A unique website to easily **view** those pictures, lists, comments, and suggestions.

Website: [www.github.com/johnbinford/applewood-pointe](http://www.github.com/johnbinford/applewood-pointe)

To keep things simple… I propose that we send our information (lists, pictures, information) to

that single email mailbox. Behind the scenes, a moderator will consolidate and organize what

is sent and place the content on the web page. A folder for each resident and a main page

listing “top contenders” and a discussion is easy to do. (Github is used because it’s free and

simple. Alternative suggestions welcome!)

I will coordinate (until / if) we find someone better. ☺

Eric.
