#### Workshop Interest Group 2024 Summary Report



Prior to Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Resident move ins, the “Gang of Four” (Linelle Johnson, Ralph Lavansky, Eric Strandjord, & Jack Weidenbach – also included Dave Porter but he died before being able to move in) signed up people who wanted to be “Workshop Users” from those who attended Applewood Point of Apple Valley Meetings prior to its opening.

Eric Strandjord, aka John Binford, created an Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Workshop website ( www.github.com/johnbinford/applewoodpointe ), and the “Gang of Four” held meetings with those on the Workshop Users Email List - that was developed from those who signed up.  Through emails and meetings, pending “Workshop Users” sent in pictures of the workshop tools and equipment they had to donate to the Workshop which were added to the website) and from these we determined which ones we wanted.  Thus eliminating the problem of excess equipment piling up in the workshop once we moved in.

Ralph Lavansky drafted a Workshop Users Manual of Workshop Operations and Procedures  ( APAV061724WorkshopUsersManual ) which was reviewed and edited by all (“Gang of Four” & pending “Workshop Users”) prior to move in, and reviewed and edited by Sarah McDonagh, Housing Manager, after our move in.

Once all the residents were moved in, and we had all resident donated tools and equipment piled on the Workshop floor, the “Gang of Four” organized and setup the Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Workshop – with manual hand tools placed in the rolling tool cabinets located in the Workshop Store Room, power hand tools placed in the wall cabinets located in the Workshop Store Room and in the floor cabinet located in the main Workshop Room, large Workshop tools and equipment located on the floor of the main Workshop Room, and supplies & other equipment located on the wire rack located in the Workshop Store Room along with a file cabinet containing tool and equipment manuals on how to use and maintain our tools and equipment.  We also have a drop box located within the Workshop for Workshop donations and Workshop suggestions from Workshop Users.

With Jack Weidenbach and Linelle Johnson being the power users and most knowledgeable woodworkers, they are the ones most frequently in the Workshop assisting others in safe use and operation of our tools and equipment.

All “Gang of Four” have been maintaining tools and equipment, repairing tools and equipment, replacing broken parts, saw blades, drill bits, & supplies, and although other Workshop Users have given donations the “Gang of Four” have been bearing the blunt of these expenses.

Hopes are that once we have our Resident Board of Directors established, a budget will be developed to pay Workshop expenses.
