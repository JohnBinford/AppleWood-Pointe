-  Your moderators will put a tool with a face to include it in our final inventory.
-  Once we have a sorted list or CraftsMen selections, </br>
John will forward it to everyone for final comments, etc.
-  Tools shown on this page will be placed into groups of like tools and then numbered within that group, so that the innocent might be proteceted.
   -  For example, this first (trial) group of band saws have no names and are numbered 1 through 6.
   -  The Floor Standing Drill Presses are numbered 1 throuigh 3.

  - John Binford knows that one of the "delta" lookalikes has new tires and blocks.
    - Some might have bearings instead!
