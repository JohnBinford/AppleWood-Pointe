## Experimental Tool sorting page.

-  Tools shown on this page will be placed into groups of like tools and then numbered within that group, so that the innocent might be proteceted.
   -  For example, this first (trial) group of band saws have no names and are numbered 1 through 6.
-  If we agree to use a page like this, we will allow some time for everyone to think </br> and then ask that choices be mailed to John Binford for compilation.
-  Your moderators will put a tool with a face to include it in our final inventory.
-  Once we have a sorted list,  John will forward it to everyone for final comments, etc.

#### Please mentally note what order you would choose to select a couple of bandsaws...

- Note that some tools might look clean and nice, but are missing a key feature like a fence.
- John Binford knows that one of the "delta" lookalikes has new tires and blocks.
  - Some might have bearings instead!
  - John also notes that a couple have "unloader" levers while some a good fences, etc.
- Please take a careful look to make your choices :-)
