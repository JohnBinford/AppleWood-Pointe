## This page is for testing until March 2023!
### Input appreciated! (Email johnathan.binford@gmail.com)
#### Exmplaination for testers.

-  John and a few other have discussed how we all might want to elect which donated tools the shop can use.
-  We discussed a few options in order to make things easy for CraftMen of all tech level to vote easily.
   - Use an online voting system.  (Like the one we are tesing below.)
   - Circulate a ballot of some type via email for those that request it.
   - Allow CraftsMen to appoint John or another to be a proxy and vote for them.
   - Appoint 3 CraftMen to do the whole thing.
   - Other stuff you might suggest...
#### Goals
-  We hope to have collected tools lists from anyone interested in a possible donation by the end of Narch 2023.
   - A few simple voting methods will be provided.
-  Based on Member CraftsMen elections, our moderators will put a list of recommendations</br>
to be emailed to all shop members.
   - We will await final comments.
-  The final list will be sent out, so that we all may start prepairing to move.

#### The "Real Page" (now experimental) starts below...

## Experimental Online Tool sorting page.
-  This page will be linked to by our surevy system.
-  You can then refer back to it, while you vote!
   -  Some helpful notes located at bottom of page.  TLDR for some!

#### Please make note what tools you would choose (by tool-type and number)to select two tools in each family...
- NOTE!  Ranked choices only available on paid services, so you will be asked to vote for two! 
  - We are trying to find a free service that has ranked choices, but have not found any.

- Note that some tools might look clean and nice, but are missing a key feature like a fence.
  - John Binford knows that one of the "delta" lookalikes has new tires and blocks.
    - Some might have bearings instead!
    - John also notes that a couple have "unloader" levers while some a good fences, etc.
