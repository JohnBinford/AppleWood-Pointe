### 10/25/2022 Workshop Meeting Action Items (Coopers Restaraunt)

- 12 CraftsMen recently met at Coopers in Eagan to discuss the shop.
  - We agreed to a goal of having our lists together by the end of March, so we can elect tools in April.
#### Here's a synopsis of what we discussed.
- For those of you who have not responded, or if you will not be donating...
   - Donations are not required, but we need to know either way.  (Your talents alone are appreciated.)
   - We have determined that we all want to know what is needed and what can be otherwise disposed of by May 2023.
     - We want to avoid a pile of tools on the floor, most to be thrown away.
   - Please send your tool's pictures and lists to johnathan.binford@gmail.com.
     - John will anonomize your items and build a web page just for your offerings and lists.
     - www.github.com/johnbinford/applewoodpointe
 - Also we agreed that it would be nice to have pictures, a bit of biographical information, and your interests <br>
 on the website so that we can get to know each other.  
   - A bit of information will also let our leadership group serve you better.
   - Please send your information and a snapshost to johnathan.binford@gmail.com.
     - John  will anonmize this information and place it on your tools page, or a new informational page.
 #### At the lunch meeting we set a goal to know what to do with our Workshop equipment and tools by Spring. </br>   So you'll need to get your equipment, tool pictures, and lists on our website by the new year.
