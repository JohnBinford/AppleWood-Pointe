- Workshop Use Application & Waiver  ……………………………………  (available from Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Property Manager)


Introduction

As residents of Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley this is our home.  And just as in our previous homes, we'd like to be able to go to and use our Workshop (or any other common area) whenever we want to without telling or reporting to anyone.  However, just like in our previous homes, if more than one home member uses the Workshop, we need to agree on Workshop User responsibilities; and for all of us to take our own individual responsibility on this.

Welcome all, you can use the Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Workshop without joining a membership.  But we are hoping if you decide to use the Workshop, that you will get to know and have fun with the other users, helping each other out in safe equipment and shop operations.  We want it to be fun.  That's the atmosphere we're striving for in our Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Workshop.

Workshop keys will be given to any resident who agrees with and signs the Workshop Use Application & Waiver.  These applications are available from the Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Property Manager, who will give you a key when you return your completet and signed Workshop Use Application and Waiver form.

Workshop Users Manual

Welcome to the Workshop Users Group of Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley.  This Manual has been prepared for you, as a Workshop User, to help you understand the Workshop’s operation and the procedures necessary to enable Workshop Users to productively and safely use the Workshop.  The Workshop is an inherently dangerous place, and our primary concern is always to promote and ensure safety.  This is your Workshop, but our rules may not be the same as those you followed in your previous home workshop.  The procedures described herein, when followed conscientiously, will allow for a clean, safe environment and operation in a manner that will accommodate the collective Workshop Users.  All Workshop Users are expected to adhere to the requirements detailed in this Manual.

1 – Workshop Operations

Workshop Safety Rules
In the interest of personal safety and to protect shop tools and equipment owned by Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley, any residents utilizing the Workshop equipment must observe the following basic, common sense rules:
 
1]  The Workshop is for the use of the residents of Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Cooperative.  Children and  other guests are not allowed in the Shop unless accompanied by their Resident Host.

2]  Tools and equipment in the Workshop belong to Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Cooperative and must meet safety regulations.  Residents should place personal hand tools, which they do not wish to loan to others, in a locked cabinet or a toolbox that is clearly marked with their name and unit # on it; and because of limited space in the Workshop should be kept in their unit or unit storage area when they are not in the Workshop.

3]  It is strongly recommended that two persons be in the Workshop when using power tools.  Goggles or some other protective face shield should be worn when using power tools.  Loose fitting clothing should not be worn while operating the power equipment.

4]  Hazardous materials, such as combustible paints, stains, varnish, etc., are to be stored in a metal cabinet for that purpose.

Anyone wishing to work in the Workshop must have signed the Workshop Use Application & Waiver, which includes the following Hold Harmless or Liability/Policy Statement:

- “I have read the Workshop Users Manual & Safety Rules, and I agree to observe and abide by them.  I further agree to work in the Workshop always at my own risk and to indemnify and hold the Applewood Pointe Cooperative of Apple Valley, its Board of Directors, and its agents and representatives harmless of any damages I may sustain.  This release is binding on my heirs, successors and assigns.”


The Executive Committee may restrict your use of any Workshop machines or resources.  You will receive written notification of this decision.

Workshop Users are to sign in and sign out whenever using the Workshop.  If you are inexperienced; do not attempt to use or operate any Workshop machines, equipment, tools, or resources without first checking with another Workshop User to learn correct and safe operation.

2 – Workshop Cleanliness
Dust and Debris Collection
Activate the dust collectors and check that the relevant gate is open when using machines and tools that connect   
to the dust collection system.  Close the gate and turn off the dust collector when you finish.  Attach vacuums to portable saws, sanders and similar tools if they are used away from the downdraft table.

If a dust collection system, down draft table, or other central dust remediation system is not in place, ensure that best practices are used to mitigate the distribution of dust throughout the Workshop.

After each use of a machine or work bench, before moving to another machine or area, clean up saw dust, spills, and debris created by your work from machines, tools, work benches, and floors.  If a noticeable amount of debris collects while you are working, suspend working and clean up.

Before leaving the Workshop for the day; clean your work area and tools, and then police the Workshop and tidy up anything as needed.

Restocking and Cleanup
Put away tools, hardware, finishes, solvents, adhesives, and materials after each use.

Clean glue brushes before adhesives dry out on the brushes.  Safely dispose of syringes used in glue application to prevent injury to others.  Clean applicators used for wood filler or other materials to remove all residue.  Do not pour any used materials in the sink.

Spillage
Immediately clean up spilled fluids, adhesives, & other substances.  Do not pour any used materials in the sink.

Do not leave wet rags or objects on machine tables or work benches.

Use spray paints, paint strippers  and similar materials in the designated painting area within the Workshop, and in a manner to prevent damage to property near the area where the materials are used.  If there are other Workshop Users in the Workshop, they should be consulted on the potential painting activity prior to it's start.

Consume food or drink outside the Workshop.  Alcoholic beverages may not be consumed in the Workshop.

3 – Personal Injury or Another Emergency

Workshop Users Responsibility
Workshop Users are expected to monitor their own health status and adhere to instructions and recommendations of medical personnel regarding the use of Workshop machines and tools, and other activities they conduct in the Workshop.  Leave the Workshop immediate if you suddenly feel weak, dizzy, or disoriented.  The Workshop does not have medical insurance.  Each Workshop User is responsible to maintain his/her own medical insurance policy.  Medical bills from an injury sustained in the Workshop will have to be paid by the Workshop User and Workshop User's medical insurance.

Minor Injury
Administer first aid.

Serious Injury or Health Emergency
Administer first aid if possible and get to help immediately.

---  Page 2  ---

If there is another Workshop User present in the Shop at the time, it is strongly recommended that they administer first aid, recover and safeguard severed body parts, make necessary phone calls, flag down the responding EMS unit, and ensure that EMS personnel will have a clear path to the area where they will respond.

When EMS personnel arrive, provide all requested assistance and information.

When the emergency is over, clear the work area where the injury occurred, clean up any blood or other substances, and put away the tools, hardware and materials the Workshop User was using.

4 – Paint Procedures

Hazardous materials, such as combustible paints, stains, varnish, etc., are to be stored in a metal cabinet for that purpose.

A supply of masking materials is provided in the painting area. They should be placed on the table beneath the area where you will apply paint or a finish to catch spills.

Use extreme care NOT to get any of your finish on any other projects in the paining area or anywhere in the Workshop room.  Arrange ample separation space between your work area and any other Workshop User's items.
  
When you have completed a coat of paint or finish, move your item to a drying area.

Clean up after yourself.  Dispose of contaminated rags in the container in the painting area.  Wipe the top of the can before re-affixing the lid to prevent spattering.  Cover the lid with a paper towel or scrap of newspaper before hammering the lid on to avoid splattering.

Clean paint brushes used with water-based finishes in the shop sink, and clean the sink when finished.

Clean oil-based finishes from brushes in the painting area.  Dispose of volatile cleaning fluids in the designated red safety can.  Do not dispose of volatile cleaners in the Workshop sink.  Do not pour any used materials in the sink.  Do not leave brushes soaking in open containers of volatile cleaners.  Brushes left unattended will be thrown away at the end of the day.

If you have leftover paint or finish after your project and want to donate the remainder for use by other Workshop Users,  write the month and year on the top of the can and place it in the paint area.

5 – Breakage, Outage of Machines and Tools

We are very lenient about accidental breakage, it happens to everyone.  If a machine, tool, blade, bit, or other part breaks, stops unexpectedly, won't start, is misaligned, shows excessive wear or damage, or is otherwise inoperable, mark any broken or separated machine, parts, or items.  Then place the broken, damaged, or worn out parts and/or items in designated area.  Inform other Workshop Users.  Do not ignore or hide broken parts or conceal breakage, since this slows down the ability to effect repairs or replacement.

6 – Wood Storage
Wood Storage
Wood storage is intended for short term (60 to 90 days) storage of lumber and materials
while a project is planned and underway.

---  Page 3  ---

All lumber and materials placed in wood storage must be labeled or marked with the owner's name.  Postal mailing labels are recommended.  You may be requested to remove unused lumber by the Executive Committee.

You are expected to respect the ownership claim evidenced by the placement of a name label or marking on lumber or other materials stored.
 
Storage of Project Items While Work is in Progress
Work in progress items may only be kept in the Workshop during the days while being worked on.

Wood Available to All Workshop Users
The wood storage area also contains excess / donated / unclaimed lumber that may be used by any Workshop User for projects in the Shop.  Wood taken from this source is for immediate use only, not stored for “future” use.

Wood placed in a Shop trash can is considered abandoned & available for common use by any Workshop User.

Donating Lumber
You may donate excess lumber and materials to the Workshop when you complete or cancel a project.  You should move donated lumber to wood storage and remove your name from it.

Wood Storage Safety
You must remove nails, screws and other dangerous elements from lumber before it is first placed in storage.  This does not apply to items that have been dry-fit or partially assembled during work on a project.  Such items must be stored in a manner to prevent injury from protruding nails, screws, or other elements, or from falling pieces.
7 – Workshop Usership

As stated on page  ---  ii  ---  under Introduction, Workshop use is available to any Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley resident who agrees with and signs the Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Workshop Use Application & Waiver.  Workshop Users are entitled to use all the machines, tools and supplies owned by and available in the Workshop.

Applications are available from the Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Property Manager.  The original signed Workshop Use Application & Waiver form will be filed with the Workshop Committee, a photocopy will be given to the resident who has signed, and to the Property Manager Office.

The Executive Committee may revoke the Workshop Usership of any Workshop User who fails to conform to the rules defined in this Manual, or applicable laws.

8 – Workshop Courtesy and Decorum

It is expected that you will behave with courtesy and decorum while in the Workshop.

If you prefer using your own hand tools over Workshop provided hand tools, you are expected to distinctly mark them with your name and unit #, and to keep them in your unit or unit storage area when you are not in the Workshop.  You are expected to honor the ownership claim demonstrated by labels or markings on tools, lumber, hardware and other materials you encounter in the Workshop.

It is hoped that you would safely provide collegial assistance and instruction to other Workshop Users when requested or the need is obvious, and satisfying the request is feasible.

9 – Non-Workshop Users Visitors in the Shop

If confronted by a visitor to the Shop, greet them courteously.  If your activities permit, you may provide a tour of the Workshop to a visitor or prospective Workshop User.

You are not required to cease working to accommodate the presence of a visitor, unless requested by appropriate law enforcement or emergency response personnel.

You may bring a guest as a visitor to the Workshop to observe your activities.  Your guest must be near you at all times and must leave the Workshop when you do.  You are expected to introduce your guest to the other Workshop Users in the Workshop. You must ensure that your guest signs in and out and provides emergency contact information.

Visitors are not permitted to use Workshop machines, tools or other resources.  Your guest, under your close supervision and direction, may assist your efforts to measure and mark your items for cutting, move your items within the Workshop, hold your items for clamping or gluing, and perform similar activities which do not involve their use of Workshop tools or machines.

10 – Shop-Provided Supplies

The Workshop provides a limited supply of consumable material, such as latex gloves, paint rags, paper towels, and dust masks.  In addition, a varying supply of miscellaneous fasteners and hardware is available to all Workshop Users.  You are expected to maintain your own supply of consumable and expendable materials which you frequently use, such as glue, fasteners and hardware.

11 – Incident Review Process
 
When you believe that a problem exists in the general safety conditions or operations of the Workshop, or if you observe an activity in the Workshop which you believe is unsafe, unethical, illegal, or harmful to the rights of Workshop Users and their property, your duty and first recourse is to inform other Workshop Users and to alert the Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Property Manager, whose responsibility is to make sure that the issue is addressed.

The Shop Executive Committee reviews and assesses incident reports and other Workshop Members issues to determine whether corrective action is needed to mitigate the incident and prevent or reduce the risk of recurrence.  The Executive Committee may pursue one or more follow-up actions, including training, replacement or alteration of equipment, procedural changes, and actions focused on individual Workshop Users.

When the Executive Committee decides to take action focused on an Individual Workshop User, the Executive Committee will issue a written notice to the Workshop User explaining their judgment and providing their preliminary decision.  The preliminary decision may require a Workshop User to perform a specific action, or restrict the Workshop User's usage of some or all Workshop machines and equipment, or revoke Workshop Usership in the Workshop User Group.  The  Workshop User will have 30 days to respond to the preliminary decision, and may agree to comply with the preliminary decision, oppose the decision, or propose an alternative course of action.  The Executive Committee will review the response and render a final decision.  If the Workshop User chooses, they may request that the final decision be reviewed at a General Member Meeting.  The decision will be placed on the agenda of the General Member Meeting as a motion, and the Workshop User will be allowed ten minutes to state their case.  The decision of the assembled Executive Committee Members will be final.

12 – Peer Mentors

All Workshop Users, when feasible, may serve as Workshop Peer Mentors.  A Peer Mentor is a Co-Workshop User who holds the same level of responsibility and the same level hierarchically as any other Workshop User, and often encounter comparable types of Workshop issues and situations as any other Workshop User.

Workshop Users; when requested by other Workshop Users, knowledgeable in the area of need, and agreeable with the request; are available to help inexperienced Workshop Users learn safe equipment operation and woodworking skills.  If you need help in these areas, or have other questions, ask another Workshop User.

All Workshop Users have the ongoing responsibility to be knowledgeable of the safe operation of Workshop machines and equipment, to receive and communicate Workshop Users concerns to the Executive Committee relating to safety, equipment, and Workshop operations, and to be aware of the overall Workshop safety conditions.   A Workshop User acting as a Workshop Peer Mentor can help you gain this insight.

This type of mentoring relationship can be a boon to both the Workshop User and the Workshop Peer Mentor, as each likely has different skills that they are bringing to the table that can be leveraged to learn from each other and grow in ways that would be difficult to accomplish otherwise.

Peer mentoring is also highly effective when on-boarding as it helps new Workshop Users form early connections  and collaborate during those first few months as a new Workshop User.

13 – Donations

The Workshop will accept donations of funds, lumber, equipment or other tangible items free and clear of any conditions or stipulations.  The Workshop will record and issue receipts for donations.

The Workshop will not accept loans of equipment or other tangible items.

14 – Borrowed Tools

Workshop Users may borrow tools for overnight, noncommercial use.  Borrowed tools must be returned the following Workshop work day.  Tools are to be signed out when being borrowed, and signed back in when being returned.
