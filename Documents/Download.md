## Documentation for the Workshop
#### Note!
- This free website has no ONLINE viewer for PDF Documents, so you must download them.
  - Just click one of the links below.
  - You will see a NEW (mostly blank) page. 
    - Ignore the "spinning" circle in the middle of the page.
  - Click the DOWNLOAD "box" on the right.
    - Wait for the documents to download (you won't get a message, just pay attention please).
    - Use your browser's "back" arrow to return to this page when your are done downloading.
      - With my browser, it does not seem to hurt to backup too soon.  YMMV
#### The Draft documents become effective after the Resident Board is established, etc.
