## Documentation for the Workshop
#### Note!
- This free website has no ONLINE viewer for Documents, so you must download them.
  - Just click one of the links below.
  - You will see a NEW (mostly blank) page (Ignore the "spinning" circle in the middle).
  - Find the DOWNLOAD "box" on the right.
  - Just click the appropriate one, wait for the documents to download, and then use your browser's "back" arrow to return to this page when your are done downloading.
#### The Draft documents become effective after the Resident Board is established, etc.
