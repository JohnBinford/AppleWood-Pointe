## Documentation for the Workshop
- PDF documents are good becuase they usually print to scale.
  - If you want to use your fancy Applewood Pointe Ruler, Use the PDF's.

        
#### The Draft documents become effective after the Resident Board is established, etc.

#### Note!
- Don't Right-Click one of the links below.  (This free webserver is wierd.)
- You just "Left-Click" (regular click for many of us...) to open a download window.
  - You will see a new preview page. 
    - If you see a "spinning" circle in the middle of the page or an empty looking page instead of a preview, ignore it and continue.
  - Click the DOWNLOAD "box" on the right.  (It looks like a little tray with a down-pointing arrow.)
    -  It says "download raw file" when you hover. 
    - Wait for the documents to download (you won't get a message, just pay attention please).
    - Use your browser's "back" arrow to return to this page when your are done downloading.
      - With my browser, it does not seem to hurt to backup too soon.  YMMV
