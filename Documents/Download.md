## Documentation for the Workshop
- PDF documents are good becuase they usually print to scale.
  - If you want to use your fancy Applewood Pointe Ruler, Use the PDF's.
#### Note!
- Some Browsers have  NO INLINE viewer for PDF Documents, or have "security settings" that prevent inline viewing (in your browser's window) - from certain websites. So you must download them blind sometimes.  
  - John B. has three computers that show the PDF, but his favorite does not!
- Just click one of the links below.
  - You will see a new preview page. 
    - If you see a "spinning" circle in the middle of the page or an empty looking page instead of a preview, ignore it and continue.
  - Click the DOWNLOAD "box" on the right.
    - Wait for the documents to download (you won't get a message, just pay attention please).
    - Use your browser's "back" arrow to return to this page when your are done downloading.
      - With my browser, it does not seem to hurt to backup too soon.  YMMV
#### The Draft documents become effective after the Resident Board is established, etc.
