## Documentation for the Workshop
#### Note!
- This free website has no ONLINE viewer for Documents, so you must download them.
  - Right-Clicking (Using the Right Mouse button) is the traditional way to download something.
  - (No harm is done if you click "normally", just "Back up" and try the othre button :-)   )
#### The Draft documents become effective after the Resident Board is established, etc.
