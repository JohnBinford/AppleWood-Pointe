#  Apple Wood Pointe Hobby Shop

## This repository is a simple place to share ideas and pictures in order to prepair our hobbyshop at AWP.

- Interim Moderator Eric S. will gather pictures and information, and then post it all here for easy viewing.
- A folder will be created for each resident, and a master page will showplace various tools and ideas.
- The table above shows recent activity, you can click the folders or activity to see the information.
- Verbiage next to each folder indicates the most recent activity for that folder.
- There is plumbing in place for a vent and some other service, and a "vault" near the door.
  - To-do number 1 is to get a list of what's provided.  (Not much it seems :-)  )


## Some Pictures from the Eden Prarie Shop!

- I noted a nice air compressor in the "vault" near the door.  (There is a hose real on the ceiling.)
