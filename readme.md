#### Recent updates to this website
  - Ralph recently sumitted our Draft Manual and other documentation.
    - Shoot!  John thought he had a download link working, but it failed suring the second test an hour later ! ?????
    - Now trying another method.  (I guess we get what we pay for, when we use free hosting services!)
 
  - Dave-P recently offered a few pictures of his major tools, he has a ton that are not pictured as well!    [Link to Dave's Profile](./CraftsMen/Dave-P/readme.md)
  - Jim-W recently added a few more pictures of some nice tools!  He also suggested a poll to see what we all might want!  Please email johnathan.binford@gmail.com with your suggestions!  Please!
  
  - John Binford recentlhy added a few screenshots from the City Planning Document.</br>

  - Ralph-L recently sent in a picture of his new Cross Feed Table!  (See Below)
  
  - Ralph, Eric, Linelle, and Dave recently toured the Eagan Shop!
    -  We were able to talk to some residents and got a few good ideas.  
    [Link to Pictures from the Eagan Shop](./Other-Shops/Eagan/readme.md)</br>
    
  - A scaled drawing of the shop has been placed in the Collateral folder above.  (3/16 scale)
    - Click "Collateral" above, and then ***Right Click*** "AWP-Shop-Dimentioned.PDF" and choose download.
      - (This website does not do hyperlinks to PDF's well.)
      - A link to a JPG of the drawing follows.  Remember that JPG's may not print to scale like a PDF. </br>

  - John Binford (AKA Eric-S) visited a friend at the GreenHouse Coop in Saint Paul. </br>

#### Recent Member Suggestions and things to think about:
- During the Fall Luncheon, John B. Determined that the ventilation provided will NOT be useful for a paint booth. </br>  (A ton of things change if a "hood" is involved due to code.)  We will need to "build" our own.
  - The storage area next to the shop has HVAC in it, so we can't use it right away.
  - John B. will be talking to Colleen about getting locking receptables on the ceiling for electrical Cable drops.  (Both 110 and 220, Single phase.)  Google "cable drop".
- It might be nice for us to know our unit numbers.  Please email if you wish to have yours on the email list.
- AWP won't furnish much for the space.
  - Benches, cabinets, chests, and storage need consideration.
  - [Click here to see Sample accessories.](./Collateral/accessories.md)
- Four fellows have been gathering suggestions from other shops and have started other "Deep Thoughts".
  - Electing Tools:  
    - We need to decide how many of each we want.
    - The best doesn't just mean heavy duty permanent placement equipment, but should include best portable equipment (table saws. miter saws, etc.) which can be easily set up when needed, placed where they can best be used with material being cut, and then easily taken down (folded) and be placed out of the way to provide more room in the Shop for other projects to be worked on at the time.
  - As yet unconsidered tools:   
    - Lathes, - vices, - panel saw, - metal working machines (milling machine) which no one has submitted so far.
  - What will our policies be?
    - Who gets a key?  
      - AWP will  give shop keys to every resident who signs a waiver. Not just wood shop members.  
	  Does this mean that they are O.K. with any resident entering the shop at any time, even if they are alone? 
    - Should we have a Workshop Manual?  One of the guys is working on a sample.
