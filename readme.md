## News
###  The "Gang of Four" recently met to finalize a few minor changes to our large tools list.

-  A new guy John Beyer, contacted John Binford and offered a few really nice tools; including a new in the box Miter Saw!
   -  Linelle Johnson was going to bring his, but he has offered to "keep it", and have John bring his nicer saw to the shop.
   -  Linelle will keep his Miter Saw in reserve until we know for sure.
-  There was a bit of disucssion about shop safety.
   - The gang concluded that certain items MUST have certtain guards and other safety attachments - especially on Table Saws.
      -  We decided to check on the current says that we elected, and came up with alternatives if necessary.
      -  Specifically, we noted that the prosumer saw that Lan Copt offered looked to be missing those devices.
      -  Linelle had recently offered a Swiss-built Table saw that has safety and many other jigs and attachments that would be a good alternative.
-  Linelle had also offered a belt sander, but noted that another Craftman offered a better one.
   -  John  will try to locate that item and get it on board

### You might remember some email chatter about  the fact that 13 of us met at the Dakota County Library to chat about shop stuff.
	
- The shop website was reviewed as a foundation for various discussions.

- Until that meeting, organizers had concentrated on settling the disposition of large electric shop tools.  (The stuff that’s hard to move without planning…)
  - Letting potential donors know what will be needed and what they might need to otherwise dispose of was the group's primary job.
  - Eric S. produced some lists with pictures of large shop tools the still needed some type of decision.
  - After that constructive discussion, the group unanimously agreed to stand with the recommendation of the Gang of Four - (Busybodies that have been working on shop issues since 2021).

 - A spreadsheet representing the list of what large shop tools various craftsmen should plan to bring to the shop is liniked below.
   - Please check out the list, and plan to bring any items highlighted in green!  Thanks a ton to those that participated.      
     -  A link to the PDF of the Large Tools Selection Spreadsheet lies below.
        -  Some browsers won't allow direct links to documents - it just appears to "spin".
        -  If so, just download it using the icon on tohe top right.  (An arown pointing down into a little tray.)</br>

## The 13 CraftsMen discussed what to do with smaller power tools and hand tools.
   - A goal is to have a nice collection of "portable" tools that can be "checked out" for use outside of the shop.
   - We settled on using a "common sense" approach.
   - If you have something that's unique, common but new, or potentially popular we encourage donating it to the shop.

## One of the guys wondered what the strange square metal "pipe" was in the ceiling of a commoon area.
-  John recently spotted this collection of those pipes in Stacy's recent picture upload.
   -  If anyone knows what they might be, please email John.  johnathan.binford@gmail.com </br>

<img src = "./Collateral/Strange-Pipe.png"> </br>
</br>
-  Here's an earlier picture of one of those heavy looking pipes in the overhead somewhere...</br>

<img src = "./Collateral/Pipe-2.png"> </br>
</br>

- With the help of Doug,  John speculates that these heavy pipes are "guides" to allow for a "rope" to be "dangled" from the eaves of each unit.  (You can see them protruding throiugh the soffits centered on the main window of each unit.)
  - One would go into the attic with a special rope with a small weight and feed it through the end of this pipe from the catwalk that's already up there...
  </br>
- Sometimes the trick to a successful google search is to learn the terminology.
  - I read started with “Rope Descent Equipment” and after about ten steps found the term “Rigging Sleeve”
  - A quick new search found these…. </br>
 <img src = "./Collateral/Rigging-Sleeve-1.png"> </br>
 <img src = "./Collateral/Riggin-Sleeve-2.png"> </br>
 
 - I think those long square tubes are indeed for window washing —  just a home made version of a cmmercial product.

-  Here is the Electrical drawing recently submitted to the Engineers.
   -  NOTE!  John heard back from the engineer.  He noted that they would not provide such a comprehensive electrical serivce.
      - They only provide the basics. 
      - John guesses that we might have to do this ourselves.

## Craftmen's Profiles...
-  A picture and a bit of information about our CraftsMen could help us get to know each other!
   -  [Link to the new Profile Page!](./Collateral/Profiles.md)

## Large Tool Offerings...
-  Our group has met, and decided what large tools our members will be bringing to the shop.
   -  (We spent a lot of time and a little effort exchanging ideas, and then voted on which tools CraftsMen should bring to the shop.)
   - (The big heavy stuff requires prior planning, so the owner can either donate, or sell (etc.)  as he plans his move.)

## The Proposed Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Workshop Manual is Complete! 
1. Initially, until ownership transfers to the resident Board of Directors (see item 3), </br>
we must abide by the builder provided Applewood Point of Apple Valley's single page SHOP SAFETY RULES.
2. No other Workshop policies or manuals may be used until handover.</br>
3. Once the resident Board of Directors has been established,</br>
our group's more comprehensive Workshop Users Manual may be adopted.
  - Compiled with input from us Workshop Users, we believe this more comprehensive Workshop Users Manual</br> developed based upon our needs, concerns, and recommendations better meets our Workshop User needs.</br>  This draft, to be revisited for final review when the above takes place, </br>will be kept held on our Workshop Website:  www.github.com/johnbinford/applewoodpointe
