 ### Let John Binford know if you have any ideas for making our nice workshop welcoming, useful, and safe? 
-  *Guidelines for happy cooperative-style sharing...*
   -  Connect a dust collector to the machines that have an outlet.
   -  Please sweep up your dust otherwise.
   -  Clean up your own mess, and any other you might find if you can.
   -  Use the sign-out sheet (above the yellow cabinet) to borrow tools.

### REALLY OLD but still pertinent News
- Our provisional leaders (Eric, Linelle, Jack, and Ralph) met with Sara to talk about the workshop.
  - Sara is anxious to work with our group and we all beleive that she has a positive effect on our co-op.  And carries her constructive attitude to the shop too!
  - We established that while nearly everyone will have access to the shop, there are some considerations that must be addressed.
    - Our nice new shop has some (Big - Dangerous) power tools that require experience, training, or both.
  - Please be careful when visiting our nice shop.  
    - We nearly finished organizing tools, furniture, and other items.
    - We have to purchase a few safety related items.  (For example, a fireproof oily rag container.)
    - We might have finished a bit of contruction associated with our new dust collection systems. (See our nice present below!)
      - Some members have donated profesional-grade cabinets and shelving, some of which required hanging on the walls. 
- With Sara's support, our group leaders and known members have established guidelines and practices that will keep our shop safe and useful.
    - To that end, we will try to follow the updated preliminary Shop Manual that some of our leaders provided last year.
    - That manual (with input from all, and revisions) will eventually become the co-op's official Shop Manual.
    - The provisional manual is on this website - [Link to the PDF Documents Collection.](./Documents/Download.md)
    - The gang has talked about ventilation and painting.
      - There was discussion about Spray painting (hard to cope with), and brush painting.
      - The group decided to stick with brush painting only - for now.  A spray booth, filtration, and other items are required by various entities. 
- Weis gave our shop a nice present!
  -  Sarah kindly reminded me to look into the shop storage room.
     -  Inside was a brand new Delta dust collection system.
     -  Along with a similar unit (donated), and some dust filters - we should have good air! <br>

### Review
## Our Provisional Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Workshop Manual is Complete! 
1. Initially, until ownership transfers to the resident Board of Directors (see item 3), <br>
we must abide by the builder provided Applewood Point of Apple Valley's single page SHOP SAFETY RULES (IF they provided one).
2. No other Workshop policies or manuals may be used until handover.<br>
3. Once the resident Board of Directors has been established,<br>
our group's more comprehensive Workshop Users Manual may be adopted.
  - Compiled with input from us Workshop Users, we believe this more comprehensive Workshop Users Manual - developed based upon our needs, concerns, and recommendations better meets our Workshop User needs. This draft, to be revisited for final review when the above takes place, will be kept held on our Workshop Website:  www.github.com/johnbinford/Applewood-Pointe
