### The Workshop Special Interest Group was established for three reasons.
-  To establish a vision of what our workshop might be like.
-  To develop some operating documents to ensure safe use.
-  To help future Workshop Users with large power tools determine what to bring, and what will not be needed.
   - About 20 of us submitted pictures of various large tools.
   - With consent of the entire group, the leadership committee produced a list of tools we all might use,  and those that would be duplicates.
   - A list was proposed, evaulated, codified, and is now published via email to the group and the link below...
     -  Some browsers won't allow direct links to documents - it just appears to "spin".
     -  If so, just download it using the icon on the top right of the linked page.  (An arrow pointing down into a little tray.)

## Here's what our shop might look like.  (To scale, with scaled objects.)
-  NOTE!  Last Month, we got a better drawing of the shop!

-  Here is the Electrical drawing recently submitted to the Engineers.
   -  NOTE!  John heard back from the engineer.  He noted that they would not provide such a comprehensive electrical serivce.
      - They only provide the basics. 
      - John guesses that we might have to do this ourselves.

## Craftmen's Profiles...
-  A picture and a bit of information about our CraftsMen could help us get to know each other!
   -  [Link to the new Profile Page!](./Collateral/Profiles.md)

## Large Tool Offerings...
-  Our group has met, and decided what large tools our members will be bringing to the shop.
   -  (We spent a lot of time and a little effort exchanging ideas, and then voted on which tools CraftsMen should bring to the shop.)
   - (The big heavy stuff requires prior planning, so the owner can either donate, or sell (etc.)  as he plans his move.)

## The Proposed Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Workshop Manual is Complete! 
1. Initially, until ownership transfers to the resident Board of Directors (see item 3), </br>
we must abide by the builder provided Applewood Point of Apple Valley's single page SHOP SAFETY RULES.
2. No other Workshop policies or manuals may be used until handover.</br>
3. Once the resident Board of Directors has been established,</br>
our group's more comprehensive Workshop Users Manual may be adopted.
  - Compiled with input from us Workshop Users, we believe this more comprehensive Workshop Users Manual</br> developed based upon our needs, concerns, and recommendations better meets our Workshop User needs.</br>  This draft, to be revisited for final review when the above takes place, </br>will be kept held on our Workshop Website:  www.github.com/johnbinford/applewoodpointe
