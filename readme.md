# Applewood Pointe Workshop

## Welcome to the Applewood Pointe Workshop Special Interest Group!

### The shop needs a few bucks!
-  We are performing an inexpensive but necessary upgrade to a very nice Mini / Midi lathe that was recently donated.  It has variable speed and machined iron ways!
   -  The upgrade will significantly increase the length of the "ways" to allow longer materials to be turned.
   -  Expecting that upgrade, Linelle has removed the lathe he kindly donated (we don't need two), and given it to a worthy relative.
      -  We will get a bit more clear space to work in after the shuffle!
- A few of our Shop's CraftsMen has spent a fair bit of cash getting necessary materials and goods, and their wives won't give them any more.
  - Lumber, tools, and fittings to mount the cabinets in the storage room.
    - The poplar boards to mount the cabinets were nearly $180 alone.
      - Yikes, wood is expensive - Don't ask John about his new deck at the old house. 
  - Materials and tools to mount the air filters.
  - A fire proof rag bin.
  - Various odds and ends.
-  It would be nice to have a small kitty for supplies as well.
#### If you care to "chip in", please contact Ralph, Linelle, Jack, or Eric.
-  Or, email johnathan.binford@gmail.com and he will coordinate.
-  Sorry, it's not tax deductable :-)  ...

### News!

#### Short Version:
-  The shop is ready for light duty!
-  The "Gang of Four" (The shop's provisional busybodies and worker bees - Linelle, Jack, Ralph, and Eric) has worked almost daily for the post month and a half to get to this point. <br> Eric hurt some ribs and was out for two weeks - He thanks the other three fellows for taking up the slack.
-  The larger group of those interested in the shop (the people on our mailing list) advised that we need to cautious about stuff that can hurt us. <br>
    -  We agreed that an education and/or introduction is necessary for their use.
    - Example.  Eric had his own Delta band saw for thirty years, but the blade tensioner on the PowerMatic saw worked differently, so he needed a bit of help. <br>
   (Even a bandsaw has a few "startup procedures"!)
- For Your Safety..
  -  Make sure you are knowledgeable prior to tool/equipment use.
  - Check with other users for correct & safe operation.
- Please email johnathan.binford@gmail.com to arrange a visit, tour, or help with a project.
- Eric S, Jack W, Linelle J, or Ralph L are also very happy to give a tour, familiarize with tools, or help get started with a project.

#### Long Version:   TL:DR ?
-  Steel cabinets, shelves, and large tool chests were donated and placed in the shop's storage room.
   - The cabinets were mounted permanently to the walls by the "Gang". This "hard labor" took about a week!
     -  Lumber, mansonry bits, and hardware were purchased.
        - A few "face plates" 1 by 8 by 6 were necessary to give clearance for the mansonry bolts behind the shelves. <br> These were bolted to the block walls with steel expanding anchors.
        - The factory mounting brackets were then screwed to the face plates.  (Many Screws!)
          -  Using the intermediate face plates also allowed precise leveling so things would look good!

     (Use your browsers "back" button or arrow to continue reading...) <br> <br>
-  Ralph, Jack, and Linelle spent another three weeks with various chores.
   -  Assembling the floor standing machines that were donated. <br> (Our shop is VERY well equipped with machines that John does not know how to run!)
   -  Arranging those machines so we could think about where they should really go to efficiently use our space.
      -  Here are some links to some pictures of everything all lined up!
         -  (Yup, use that browser's back button for any going back...)
      -  [Link to more shop photos, including the floor-standing machines!](./Collateral/NewPics/Shop-Tools.md)
   -  Organizing and then stowing hand help tools in our new cabinets.  <br> (Hats off to Ralph for his sorting and labeling skills!)
      -  Manual handtools are in the rolling tool cabinets.
      -  Power Hand tools are in the wall and floor cabinets.  <br> <br>
-  The various donors of our collection all thought that "someone else" would bring small hand tools like screwdrivers, etc.
   -  John had to purchase a hammer and some drill bits for the cabinet mounting project!
   -  Thankfully Monroe L. noted our deficiency and purchased a nice collection of hand tools and donated them!!!! <br>
      - John Beyer also donated a nice set of (new in the box) power tools.  Thanks!  <br> <br>
-  We hope to soon offer specific training on idividual machines.<br>
We will do a general open house if Sarah likes the idea!
   - Sarah will announce in her newsletter, and John will email "when and where" to our mailing list as well. <br> <br>
-  We are creating more space for our casual shop users (like John) by clearing a bench and shelving a few small machines.
-  A updated - provisionary "Workshop User's Manual" is nearly complete and will be posted here, with a hardcopy or two in our files.
-  Ralph has organized our manuals and other papers in a nice file cabinet in the store room.  Thanks Ralph! <br> <br>
-  Guidelines for happy cooperative-style sharing...
   -  Connect a dust collector to the machines that have an outlet.
   -  Please sweep up your dust otherwise.
   -  Clean up your own mess, and any other you might find if you can.
   -  Use the sign-out sheet (above the yellow cabinet) to borrow tools.
 ### Let John Binford know if you have any ideas for making our nice workshop welcoming, useful, and safe.  <br>

### OLD News
- Our provisional leaders (Eric, Linelle, Jack, and Ralph) met with Sara to talk about the workshop.
  - Sara is anxious to work with our group and we all beleive that she will have a positive effect on our co-op and will carry her constructive attitude to the shop too!
  - We established that while everyone should have access to the shop, there are some considerations that must be addressed.
    - Our nice new shop will have some (Big - Dangerous) power tools that require experience, training, or both.
  - Please be careful when visiting our nice shop.  The shop really won't be useful for a while. Your patience is appreciated as our volunteers get things ready!
    - We are organizing tools, furniture, and other items.
    - We will need to purchase a few safety related items.  (For example, a fireproof oily rag container.)
    - We might have a bit of contruction associated with our new dust collection systems. (See our nice present below!)
      - Some members have donated profesional-grade cabinets and shelving, some of which require hanging on the walls. 
- With Sara's support, our group leaders and known members will establish guidelines and practices that will keep our shop safe and useful.
    - To that end, we will try to follow the preliminary Shop Manual that some of our leaders provided last year.
    - That manual (with input from all, and revisions) will eventually become the co-op's official Shop Manual.
    - The provisional manual is on this website - [Link to the PDF Documents Collection.](./Documents/Download.md)
    - The gang also talked about ventilation and painting.
      - There was discussion about Spray painting (hard to cope with), and brush painting.
      - The group decided to stick with brush painting only - for now.  A spray booth, filtration, and other items are required by various entities. 
- Weis gave our shop a nice present!
  -  Sarah kindly reminded me to look into the shop storage room.
     -  Inside was a brand new Delta dust collection system.
     -  Along with a similar unit (donated), and some dust filters - we should have good air! <br>
   <img src="./Collateral/Weis-Dust.jpg"> <br>

- John finally closed on his unit, so was able to do more than peek through the windows.
- Here are a few pictures.
- Seems like we will need a key to the storage area!
- Bonus,  it's ventilated, so with a bit of filtering we should be able to deal with fumes.
  - John has not yeat traced where the outlet is...

## Our Provisional Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Workshop Manual is Complete! 
1. Initially, until ownership transfers to the resident Board of Directors (see item 3), </br>
we must abide by the builder provided Applewood Point of Apple Valley's single page SHOP SAFETY RULES (IF they provided one).
2. No other Workshop policies or manuals may be used until handover.</br>
3. Once the resident Board of Directors has been established,</br>
our group's more comprehensive Workshop Users Manual may be adopted.
  - Compiled with input from us Workshop Users, we believe this more comprehensive Workshop Users Manual - developed based upon our needs, concerns, and recommendations better meets our Workshop User needs. This draft, to be revisited for final review when the above takes place, will be kept held on our Workshop Website:  www.github.com/johnbinford/Applewood-Pointe
