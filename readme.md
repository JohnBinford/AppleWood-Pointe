## News

### We recently met at the Eagan Public Library (Dakota County).

- The group met on 4-25-2023 to discuss the shop.
  -  13 Craftsmen out of the 20 known to be interested in the shop attended.
  -  The shop website was reviewed as a foundation for various discussions.
  -  Until this meeting, organizers have concentrated on settling the disposition of large electric shop tools.
     -  Letting potential donors know what will be needed and what they might need to otherwise dispose of was the group's primary job.
     -  Eric S. produced some lists with pictures of large shp tools the still needed some type of decision.
        - After a constructive discussion, the group unanimously agreed to stand with the recommendation of the Gang of Four - (Busybodies that have been working on shop issues since 2021).  
	- The list of who should donate what will be emailed to all members shortly.
  -  The 13 CraftsMen discussed what to do with smaller power tools and hand tools.
     - A goal is to have a nice collection of "portable" tools that can be "checked out" for use outside of the shop.
     - We settled on using a "common sense" approach.
       -  If you have something that's unique, common but new, or potentially popular we encourage donating it to the shop. </br>

-  New Guy!  Jim T and his Wife Stephanie recently purchased the unit next door to John.  At the recent luncheon, he experssed interest in the Shop.  We all look forward to getting to know them.
-  In MEMORIAM - Dave P passed away on March 4, 2023.
   - He was the first AWP buyer to reach out about getting the shop organized before occupancy. He was a creative and passionate woodworker who made everything from armoires, to adirondack chairs, to creating custom benches for the Ames Center.

- Ralph recently provided a couple of new picture of his Drill-Press-Milling-Table outfit.</br>
check out his folder in the CraftsMen folder above.
- Ralph updloaded a nice "Countdown to Selling your House" Checklist.  You can get it from the Documents Page.</br>
[Link to the PDF Documents Collection.](./Documents/Download.md)
- John submitteed an electrical plan to the Engineers recently.  
  - We asked for a bunch of duplex R5-20's spaced around each wall, and in the store room.
  - We also asked for a quad of R5-20's in the center of each wall, and two R6-20 singles on each wall.
  - 5 unique circuits and breakers were requested to allow floor-standing tools to remain plugged into the R5-20's.
  - Each quad will have it's own cicuit so that hand-held tools on cords can be accomodated in isolation from other high-draw tools.
  - Each single R6-20 (220 Volts - 20 Amps) will have it's own circuit and breaker.

## The Proposed Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Workshop Manual is Complete! 
1. Initially, until ownership transfers to the resident Board of Directors (see item 3), </br>
we must abide by the builder provided Applewood Point of Apple Valley's single page SHOP SAFETY RULES.
2. No other Workshop policies or manuals may be used until handover.</br>
3. Once the resident Board of Directors has been established,</br>
our group's more comprehensive Workshop Users Manual may be adopted.
  - Compiled with input from us Workshop Users, we believe this more comprehensive Workshop Users Manual</br> developed based upon our needs, concerns, and recommendations better meets our Workshop User needs.</br>  This draft, to be revisited for final review when the above takes place, </br>will be kept held on our Workshop Website:  www.github.com/johnbinford/applewoodpointe

   #### Some other tools... (Bringing the best stuff or unique - storing in my cage if necessary.)
   
  
- Porter Cable Circular Saw (New)
- Two Metal Tool Cabinets (Drawers)
- Lots of Mechanic's Tools
- :white_check_mark:  A few nice bar clamps (lightweight), and a few nice spring clamps.
- Cheap Square Pad Sander
- Ryobi 18" Belt Sander with Bench Mount
- Like all of us, I have a small collection of handheld power tools, and various hand tools.
- Specialty tools for electronic projects, with some test gear (Meters, power supply, Oscilloscope, etc.)
</br>

- Also have a Prusa 3DMK3S 3D printer and all the stuff needed to create and print projects.
  - I may keep upstairs.  
  - It would be nice to know if anyone shares this interest.
