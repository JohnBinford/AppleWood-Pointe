## News
- John submitteed an electrical plan to the Engineers recently.  
  - We asked for a bunch of duplex R5-20's spaced around each wall, and in the store room.
  - We also asked for a quad of R5-20's in the center of each wall, and two R6-20 singles on each wall.
  - 5 unique circuits and breakers were requested to allow floor-standing tools to remain plugged into the R5-20's.
  - Each quad will have it's own cicuit so that hand-held tools on cords can be accomodated in isolation from other high-draw tools.
  - Each single R6-20 (220 Volts - 20 Amps) will have it's own circuit and breaker.

- Five CraftsMen recent met to discuss tool submissions and next steps to getting organized.
   - Here are the "minutes of that meeting...
   
   In Attendance:  Linelle Johnson, Ralph Lavansky, Dave Porter, Eric Strandjord, & Jack Weidenbach

The attached 1:00 P.M. Tuesday, December 20th, 2022, Meeting Agenda was followed (see attached below).

All of our pending Workshop Users have now submitted their Tools / Equipment that they are considering donating to the Workshop for us to make our selections from, or have stated that they prefer we just choose from those already submitted by others.

The group went through the " APAV Workshop User Tools / Equipment Submitted" report and picked what was thought to be the best, to recommend to all to vote on (see attached below).

Eric showed examples of his selection software and group chose the one sheet pictures of each type with voting boxes to be checked next to pictures on it.  Group indicated that the recommended ones would be indicated on the sheets of each type.  And suggested that only ones we need to vote on (more than one item or number of items we want to keep) be dispersed - on website or email only, with deadline and if they don't vote just go with votes received (to be reviewed before results are sent out).  Also to include voting item asking if they prefer to just go with what others vote on, and not to vote themselves.

Communication to be sent to all users prior to the end of the year - thanking all for getting their Tools / Equipment considerations in and letting them know what we feel will be next.

The Meeting was adjourned at 4:00 P.M. .

    - A few of us are getting things organized in order to select tools where multiples were offered.
    - We also spent a couple of hours going throuigh the list of fine tools offered by our Craftsmen.
      - After carefully examining condition, features and function, age, and aspects that may not be apparrent, we have made some recommendations that will note noted below and in any "voting" materials.

## Here's what our shop might look like.  (To scale, with scaled objects.)
-  NOTE!  Last Month, we got a better drawing of the shop!  
   - (The door has moved, and the size is 1.5 feet smaller across.  We get storage!!!)

   - If you want a Scaled PDF of the simplified Shop Drawing, see the last entry in the Documents Collection
   - [Link to the PDF Documents Collection.](./Documents/Download.md)
   - AWP won't furnish much for the space.
     - Benches, cabinets, chests, and storage need consideration.
     - [Click here to see Sample accessories.](./Collateral/accessories.md)

- Here is a new rendering.  Furnishings and tools arbitrarily located for scale only.

## The Proposed Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Workshop Manual is Complete! 
1. Initially, until ownership transfers to the resident Board of Directors (see item 3), </br>
we must abide by the builder provided Applewood Point of Apple Valley's single page SHOP SAFETY RULES.
2. No other Workshop policies or manuals may be used until handover.</br>
3. Once the resident Board of Directors has been established,</br>
our group's more comprehensive Workshop Users Manual may be adopted.
  - Compiled with input from us Workshop Users, we believe this more comprehensive Workshop Users Manual</br> developed based upon our needs, concerns, and recommendations better meets our Workshop User needs.</br>  This draft, to be revisited for final review when the above takes place, </br>will be kept held on our Workshop Website:  www.github.com/johnbinford/applewoodpointe
