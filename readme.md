# Applewood Pointe Workshop

## Welcome to the Applewood Pointe Workshop Special Interest Group!
### News!

#### Short Version:
-  The shop is ready for light duty!  <br> (We need another small workbench and are thinking about that as our first "Shop Project".)
-  The "Gang of Four" (The shop's provisional busybodies and worker bees - Linelle, Jack, Ralph, and Eric) has worked almost daily for the post month and a half to get to this point. <br> Eric hurt some ribs and was out for two weeks - He thanks the other three fellows for their hard work.
-  The larger group of those interested in the shop (the people on our mailing list) advised that we need to cautious about stuff that can hurt us. <br>
    -  We agreed that an education and/or introduction is necessary for their use.
   - Example.  Eric had his own Delta band saw for thirty years, but the blade tensioner on the PowerMatic worked differently, so he needed a bit of help. <br>
   (Even a bandsaw has a few "startup procedures"!)
- Please email johnathan.binford@gmail.com to arrange a visit, tour, or help with a project.
- Eric S, Jack W, Linelle J, or Ralph L are also very happy to give a tour, familiarize with tools, or help get started with a project.

#### Long Version:
-  Steel cabinets, shelves, and large tool chests were donated and placed in the shop's storage room.
   - The cabinets were mounted permanently to the walls by the "Gang". This "hard labor" took about a week!
     -  Backer boards were attached to the block walls with many steel anchors fitting laboriously drilled holes in the block. <br>
     (We copied the hardware used to mount the cages in the parking area.)
     -  The factory mounting brackets were then attached with many (many) screws to those backer boards.)
        -   The two-step process was necessary structuraly, but also allowed precise leveling and alignment of the cabinets.

     (Use your browsers "back" button or arrow to continue reading...)
-  Ralph, Jack, and Linelle worked spent another three weeks with various chores.
   -  Assembling the floor standing machines that were donated. <br> (Our shop is VERY well equipped with machines that John does not know how to run!)
   -  Arranging those machines so we could think about where they should really go to efficiently use our space.
      -  (Yup, use that browser's back button to keep reading from here if you click below...)
      -  [Lined up floor-standing machines!](./Collateral/Shop-Tools.md)
   -  Organizing and then stowing hand help tools in our new cabinets.  <br> (Hats off to Ralph for his sorting and labeling skills!)
-  The various donors of our collection all thought that "someone else" would bring small hand tools like screwdrivers, etc.
   -  John had to purchase a hammer and some drill bits for the cabinet mounting project!
   -  Thankfully a couple of gents noted our deficiency and purchased a nice collection of hand tools and donated them!!!! <br>
-  An open house is being planned - Sarah will announce in her newsletter, and John will email "when,where,what, and why".
-  We have identified a need to provide a space for our casual users (like John).  Another small workbench will help.
   -  The Gang might start a "Shop Project" to build one!
-  A updated - provisionary "Workshop Users's Manual" is nearly complete and will be posted here, with a hardcopy or two in our files.
      -  BTW.  Ralph has organized our manuals and other papers in a nice file cabinet in the store room.  Thanks Ralph!
#### Here's a link to some pictures of everything all lined up!

### OLD News
- Our provisional leaders (Eric, Linelle, Jack, and Ralph) met with Sara to talk about the workshop.
  - Sara is anxious to work with our group and we all beleive that she will have a positive effect on our co-op and will carry her constructive attitude to the shop too!
  - We established that while everyone should have access to the shop, there are some considerations that must be addressed.
    - Our nice new shop will have some (Big - Dangerous) power tools that require experience, training, or both.
  - Please be careful when visiting our nice shop.  The shop really won't be useful for a while. Your patience is appreciated as our volunteers get things ready!
    - We are organizing tools, furniture, and other items.
    - We will need to purchase a few safety related items.  (For example, a fireproof oily rag container.)
    - We might have a bit of contruction associated with our new dust collection systems. (See our nice present below!)
      - Some members have donated profesional-grade cabinets and shelving, some of which require hanging on the walls. 
- With Sara's support, our group leaders and known members will establish guidelines and practices that will keep our shop safe and useful.
    - To that end, we will try to follow the preliminary Shop Manual that some of our leaders provided last year.
    - That manual (with input from all, and revisions) will eventually become the co-op's official Shop Manual.
    - The provisional manual is on this website - [Link to the PDF Documents Collection.](./Documents/Download.md)
    - The gang also talked about ventilation and painting.
      - There was discussion about Spray painting (hard to cope with), and brush painting.
      - The group decided to stick with brush painting only - for now.  A spray booth, filtration, and other items are required by various entities. 
- Weis gave our shop a nice present!
  -  Sarah kindly reminded me to look into the shop storage room.
     -  Inside was a brand new Delta dust collection system.
     -  Along with a similar unit (donated), and some dust filters - we should have good air! <br>

- John finally closed on his unit, so was able to do more than peek through the windows.
- Here are a few pictures.
- Seems like we will need a key to the storage area!
- Bonus,  it's ventilated, so with a bit of filtering we should be able to deal with fumes.
  - John has not yeat traced where the outlet is...

## Our Provisional Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Workshop Manual is Complete! 
1. Initially, until ownership transfers to the resident Board of Directors (see item 3), </br>
we must abide by the builder provided Applewood Point of Apple Valley's single page SHOP SAFETY RULES (IF they provided one).
2. No other Workshop policies or manuals may be used until handover.</br>
3. Once the resident Board of Directors has been established,</br>
our group's more comprehensive Workshop Users Manual may be adopted.
  - Compiled with input from us Workshop Users, we believe this more comprehensive Workshop Users Manual - developed based upon our needs, concerns, and recommendations better meets our Workshop User needs. This draft, to be revisited for final review when the above takes place, will be kept held on our Workshop Website:  www.github.com/johnbinford/Applewood-Pointe
