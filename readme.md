- John submitteed an electrical plan to the Engineers recently.  
  - We asked for a bunch of duplex R5-20's spaced around each wall, and in the store room.
  - We also asked for a quad of R5-20's in the center of each wall, and two R6-20 singles on each wall.
  - 5 unique circuits and breakers were requested to allow floor-standing tools to remain plugged into the R5-20's.
  - Each quad will have it's own cicuit so that hand-held tools on cords can be accomodated in isolation from other high-draw tools.
  - Each single R6-20 (220 Volts - 20 Amps) will have it's own circuit and breaker.

###  Email your comments, or answers and replies to johnathan.binford@gmail.com.
-  If you intend your message to be a (Group Email Discussion),</br> please note this to John Binford when emailing your Group Email to johnathan.binford@gmail.com,</br> who will forward your comments or questions as well as your replys or answers to all of us.</br>  John will also place these communications on this “Group Email Discussion” section on our website.
* * *

#### Topic:  We will need to reach out to those that purchase any of the 9 remaining units.
-  Linelle-J commented 1/18/23:  I read the new Applewood Pointe email the other day which stated there were only nine units left to sell.  We'll have to be sure that we reach out to the new arrivals that have signed up since the last meeting.  Maybe this can be done at the next luncheon on February 8th.
-  Eric-S replied 1/18/23:  I think I will get a few more business cards printed and ask (again) that the sales office hand them out whenever possible.</br>
We can also call a meeting at the February luncheon, and hand them out there too!

####  Topic:  How will this simplified discussion forum work?  (Submitted by Ralph-L.)
-  Eric-S commented 1/18/23:  John will do most of the work.  Here are instructions:
   -  (BTW... Some people call discussions "Topics", others might call them "Threads" if they are related to another.
      -  To start a conversation, email johnathan.binford@gmail.com.
         -  Indicate you want your question or comment to go to the group.
         -  John will immediately forward new questions or comments that might start a new topic to the group.
      -  To add to, or to comment on specific topics; reply to John, johnathan.binford@gmieil.com. </br>
        You may also later email John with the topic name and your comments.
         - John will regularly monitor his email for comments, wait a week or so for replies and then forward the digest with the new replys to the group.
         - He will regularly organize the threads and then post them here in digest format, occasionally forwarding the digest to the group as significant information is collected.
         - In order to be respectful of excess spam, John may consolidate comments and questions if there are many.
  
-  Ralph-L replied 01/18/23:</br>
	 After reviewing how this group discussion forum works, do you have any questions or comments?

####  Topic:  What might "Topics" or "discussions" look like? (Submitted by Eric-S.)
-  John-B replied 01/18/23: Here are some sample discussions. </br> </br>
   -  __Subject:  Other Location's Workshop Organization.__
        -  John-D question 01/20/23:</br>Have any of you heard from other Applewood location workshop users on how they organized their workshop?
        -  Donald-D replied 01/21/23:</br>Eagan Applewood user told me that they brought tools in when the time came and they then threw out ones they didn't want.
        -  William-T replied 01/21/23:</br>Edina Applewood user told me that they didn't do any prior organization before move-in."
   -  __Subject:  Tool / Equipment selection.__
        -  Billy-K question 01/22/23:</br>If I don't know the difference between the same type of tools or equipment is it O.K. not to vote?
        -  Donald-D replied 01/23/23:</br>If you don't know the difference between the same type of tools or equipment, it would be better to go with the recommended ones than not to vote at all.

####  Topic:  Website use for discussing the shop. (Submitted by Ralph-L.)
-  Ralph-L Commented 1/18/23:</br>Dear pending Workshop Users:</br>  At the first Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Luncheon, those who were interested in the Workshop got together and gave their email addresses to Eric Strandjord (John Binford). </br>
He offered to set up an internet site for all to email each other.  But no one wanted to have to "Sign Up" for anything or use any tool that required a "Sign In" or "User ID" with "Password".   So he set up a Website for the Group to use where they would only have to enter or click on johnathan.binford@gmail.com , and John would do all the "Group Email" work for them.  He has now updated this on the Website as follows below: </br> </br>
***Please let us know if and how you have used our Website, along with your comments (suggestions) on it?*** </br> </br>Thanks! </br> Ralph-L
-  Eric-S replied 01/18/23:</br>  Ralph.  Thanks for the inspiration to think about the shop for a bit.</br>- The website will serve as an archive for all the informatin we might exchange.  No going through emails!</br>- I've worked hard to keep the website fresh over the past 9 months, posting new information three times a week on average.</br>- Few of our CraftsMen have taken a peek.</br>- We've made over 1486 additions to the website during that time, including new CraftsMen profiles, and a master tool list and numerous individual lists for those that have offered major shop tools.</br>- There are now many links to pictures from other shops, constrsuction photos from AWP, documents, and drawings that would be usefull for planning the shop layout.</br>- We've communicated out electrical needs to Sales and Engineering.  A diagram is included on the website's main page, along with renders of what our shop might look like. </br>

## Here's what our shop might look like.  (To scale, with scaled objects.)
-  NOTE!  Last Month, we got a better drawing of the shop!  
   - (The door has moved, and the size is 1.5 feet smaller across.  We get storage!!!) 
   - [Link to new Dimensioned Drawing of Shop.](./Collateral/Shop-11-06-22.jpg)
   - [Link to Simplified Drawing of Shop.](./Collateral/Plans/Shop.JPG)
   - If you want a Scaled PDF of the simplified Shop Drawing, see the last entry in the Documents Collection
   - [Link to the PDF Documents Collection.](./Documents/Download.md)
   - AWP won't furnish much for the space.
     - Benches, cabinets, chests, and storage need consideration.
     - [Click here to see Sample accessories.](./Collateral/accessories.md)

- Here is a new rendering.  Furnishings and tools arbitrarily located for scale only.

- John did some practicing with his cumbersome rendering tools, and painted the walls.  He also added a desk and window!

## The Proposed Applewood Pointe of Apple Valley Workshop Manual is Complete! 
1. Initially, until ownership transfers to the resident Board of Directors (see item 3), </br>
we must abide by the builder provided Applewood Point of Apple Valley's single page SHOP SAFETY RULES.
2. No other Workshop policies or manuals may be used until handover.</br>
3. Once the resident Board of Directors has been established,</br>
our group's more comprehensive Workshop Users Manual may be adopted.
  - Compiled with input from us Workshop Users, we believe this more comprehensive Workshop Users Manual</br> developed based upon our needs, concerns, and recommendations better meets our Workshop User needs.</br>  This draft, to be revisited for final review when the above takes place, </br>will be kept held on our Workshop Website:  www.github.com/johnbinford/applewoodpointe
