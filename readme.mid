- This repository is a simple place to share ideas and pictures in order to prepair our hobbyshop at AWP.
- AWP buyer, and this page's Moderator Eric S. will gather pictures and information, 
  and then post it all here for easy viewing.
- A folder will be created for each resident, and a master page will showplace various tools and ideas.
- Verbiage next to each folder indicates the most recent activity for that folder.
