      - Besides the two samples pictured so far, I have a nice portable 10 inch table saw.</br>
      - I'm sure someone has a better one!</br>
      - Like all of us, I have a small collection of handheld power tools, and various hand tools.</br>
      - Specialty tools for electronic projects, with some test gear (Meters, power supply, Oscilloscope, etc.)</br>
      - The mechanics tools will most likely go to a nephew :-)</br>
      - Also have a Prusa 3DMK3S 3D printer, which I may keep upstairs.</br>
      - It would be nice to know if anyone shares this interest.</br>
