#  Possible offering from Eric S.

## Some samples until I take pictures of some potentially worthy tools

- Besides the two samples pictured so far, I have a nice portable 10 inch table saw.
- I'm sure someone has a better one!
- Like all of us, I have a small collection of handheld power tools, and various have tools.
  - Hand tools for electronic projects, with some test gear (Meters, power supply, Oscilloscope, etc.)
- The mechanics tools will most likely go to a nephew :-)
- Also have a Prusa 3DMK3S 3D printer, which I may keep upstairs.
  - It would be nice to know if anyone shares this interest.
